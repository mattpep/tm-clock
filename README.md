# Speech Clock

This single-page utility will give a timer that can be used to assist with the
giving of speeches. The background is initially white. It will turn green when
the minimum duration has been reached, will turn yellow when halfway between
minimum and maximum durations, and will turn red once the maximum has been
reached. 30 seconds later the background will blink.

# Requirements
Though this will work when run from a webserver it is designed to work entirely
off-line with no Internet connection necessary.

Instructions for running it on a webserver are intentionally omitted and I do
not offer support for doing this.

# Indemnty statement
I wrote this utility as a member of a local ToastMasters International club,
but it is written entirely independently by me and is not in any way endorsed
by them.
